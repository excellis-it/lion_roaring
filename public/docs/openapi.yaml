Although Lystia obtained her CPA (Certified Public Accountant) early in her career, she decided not to pursue a career in the Public Accounting but to devote her career working for an international non-profit organization working with the third world countries. It was her passion to work in an organization in which the primary mission and the vision were to help people in Third World countries to improve their standard of living.\\r\\nPrior to her retirement in 2019, she held a position as the Director of Finance (CFO) working for the largest U.S. based international worker rights organization. She helped facilitate the organization’s mission of helping workers attain safe and healthy workplaces, while promoting worker’s equality. She also helped improve workers’ standard of living with education and collective agreement, and by helping fight discrimination, and by pr eventing the exploitation of systems that entrench poverty. Her 30 plus years’ experience working with this organization gave her solid and broad mastery in all areas in financial management, financial affairs, budgeting, human resources and personnel policy and procedures. Furthermore, she developed expertise to ensure compliance with U.S. Federal Rules & regulations on grant awards, and how to effectively deal with the the organization’s funders (U.S. Government, foundation and international donors). She was responsible for the organization’s annual budget of about $32,000,000.00 and directed staff in the finance and accounting departments at the company’s headquarters, and approximately 30 filed offices. Additionally, she was a member of the Executive Team, and she worked closely with the CEO, COO and other Directors in the implementation of the organization’s vision and mission.\\r\\nSince retiring in 2019, Lystia has been volunteering her time in helping JMK Shelby, North Carolina church with their accounting and financial matters.

A love of history and the joy of working with children made this a good fit for his career change. Putting aside the content teaching aspect of this profession, most importantly, he learned the importance of relationship building with his students. Without the relationships in place, no teaching will be effective. He also learned the value of cooperative learning and “hands on” or learning by doing, while striving to make learning fun as key components for student engagement and learning. Bob used these strategies as his focus in his teaching and programs like Peer Tutoring, Homework Club, and the National Junior Honor Society that he led throughout his career.\r\nPrior to working in the education field, Bob spent over 20 years in the business world working as a team manager in the insurance industry. Responsibilities included overseeing high dollar claims settlements, personnel management, and customer service. One key takeaway from this profession was the ability to successfully communicate with various stakeholders (superiors, peers, subordinates, customers). Learning skills like compassion and simply listening to others’ needs and desires went a long way to him being able to establish rapport and successful working relationships with all stakeholders.\r\nBob retired from teaching in 2022 and has since concentrated on learning America’s “true history,” his rightful status as a united States citizen, loving on and assisting family members through trying circumstances, and by learning and relying on God to become more intimate with his Creator. Individual study and prayer, and teachings from JMK Maryland and Lion Roaring have all helped with Bob’s spiritual growth. While assisting other leaders as a Board Member of Lion Roaring, Bob is looking forward to his next journey with Lion Roaring and direction from the Lord how best to use him."
