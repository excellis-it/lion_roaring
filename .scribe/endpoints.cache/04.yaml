Responsibilites included transforming organization, people, and technologies to create new products and services. These new products and services, including modernization of infrastructures, helped establish new business services in the digital world, create new IT organizations which helped develop new cost models for Enterprise Data Inventory Strategy, Shared Services Centers, Cloud Computing services, and IT methodology. This led to a balance of score cards, performance metrics/Service Level Agreements, and business processes automation in areas of Financial, Human Resources, Acquisition, Law Enforcement, Telecommunications, Research Survey, and IT Hosting Services. Daud has held many different roles ranging from software engineer, Certified Chief IT Lead, IT Executive, and Chief Technology Officer. He has managed and had oversight over the IT budget within the range of $75,000,000 up to $2,000,000,000.\r\nThe Lord transformed Daud in 2016 after undergoing and surviving his third brain surgery at the end of 2015. He began seeking the Lord in 2016 by waiting on God every day from 3:00 to 4:30 AM. He had many spiritual encounters through dreams and visions in 2016-2017. He saw Jesus’s face in the 3rd Dimension when he was on Mt. Sinai. He also attended the Open Heaven Prophetic Conference with Prophet Sadhu Selvaraj in 2017. Since then, his life has changed as he regularly walkiswith God. He continues to experience many visions, dreams, and revelations. The Lord has taught him over the past two years as a leader under JMK Maryland (a branch of Jesus My King Church, Shelby, North Carolina) to prepare his congregation to become a wise Sower with Kingship and Priesthood anointing.\r\nAlos, during this time, he received the strategy of Lion Roaring (Kingship Authority) and established JMK Maryland (Priesthood authority) through divine intervention of the Holy Spirit as he connected with Pastor Michael Widjaya and Dr. Steven Francis. This is God’s destiny as revealed to Daud and his wife; that is to establish Kingship and Priesthood authority where Heaven is brought on earth with the office of Christ, which is the office of the everlasting Kingdom of Light.\r\nCurrently, he is the elder of JMK Maryland that helps that facilitate Lion Roaring teachings on Spiritual and Leadership Development by helping to restore one person, group, community, and nation at the time as the Lord directs him.",

                "section_2_description_2": "Lystia Santosa has over 35 years of experience working in the financial and accounting field for International Non-profit Organizations. She has held various positions during her career such as an auditor for a CPA Firm auditing the Federal Government Grant Programs, a Field Office Project Accountant and Senior Accountant, Accounting Manager, Controller, and then a Director of Finance position. Although Lystia obtained her CPA (Certified Public Accountant) early in her career, she decided not to pursue a career in the Public Accounting but to devote her career working for an international non-profit organization working with the third world countries. It was her passion to work in an organization in which the primary mission and the vision were to help people in Third World countries to improve their standard of living.\r\nPrior to her retirement in 2019, she held a position as the Director of Finance (CFO) working for the largest U.S. based international worker rights organization. She helped facilitate the organization’s mission of helping workers attain safe and healthy workplaces, while promoting worker’s equality. She also helped improve workers’ standard of living with education and collective agreement, and by helping fight discrimination, and by pr eventing the exploitation of systems that entrench poverty. Her 30 plus years’ experience working with this organization gave her solid and broad mastery in all areas in financial management, financial affairs, budgeting, human resources and personnel policy and procedures. Furthermore, she developed expertise to ensure compliance with U.S. Federal Rules & regulations on grant awards, and how to effectively deal with the the organization’s funders (U.S. Government, foundation and international donors). She was responsible for the organization’s annual budget of about $32,000,000.00 and directed staff in the finance and accounting departments at the company’s headquarters, and approximately 30 filed offices. Additionally, she was a member of the Executive Team, and she worked closely with the CEO, COO and other Directors in the implementation of the organization’s vision and mission.\r\nSince retiring in 2019, Lystia has been volunteering her time in helping JMK Shelby, North Carolina church with their accounting and financial matters. She is also the elder for JMK Maryland church alongside her husband, Daud Santosa.\r\nDuring the pandemic, the Lord brought her into a more intimate relationship with Him and helped train her to study His words on a deeper level. This helped shift her priorities from working from a worldly employer to working for God’s Kingdom. She gave up her consulting work and completely devoted her time to studying and working alongside with husband, Daud Santosa in serving the JMK Maryland church.",

              "description": "Bob Hyde spent 16 years’ working in the education field as a middle school teacher for subjects of United States and world history. A love of history and the joy of working with children made this a good fit for his career change. Putting aside the content teaching aspect of this profession, most importantly, he learned the importance of relationship building with his students. Without the relationships in place, no teaching will be effective. He also learned the value of cooperative learning and “hands on” or learning by doing, while striving to make learning fun as key components for student engagement and learning. Bob used these strategies as his focus in his teaching and programs like Peer Tutoring, Homework Club, and the National Junior Honor Society that he led throughout his career.\r\nPrior to working in the education field, Bob spent over 20 years in the business world working as a team manager in the insurance industry. Responsibilities included overseeing high dollar claims settlements, personnel management, and customer service. One key takeaway from this profession was the ability to successfully communicate with various stakeholders (superiors, peers, subordinates, customers). Learning skills like compassion and simply listening to others’ needs and desires went a long way to him being able to establish rapport and successful working relationships with all stakeholders.\r\nBob retired from teaching in 2022 and has since concentrated on learning America’s “true history,” his rightful status as a united States citizen, loving on and assisting family members through trying circumstances, and by learning and relying on God to become more intimate with his Creator. Individual study and prayer, and teachings from JMK Maryland and Lion Roaring have all helped with Bob’s spiritual growth. While assisting other leaders as a Board Member of Lion Roaring, Bob is looking forward to his next journey with Lion Roaring and direction from the Lord how best to use him.",
